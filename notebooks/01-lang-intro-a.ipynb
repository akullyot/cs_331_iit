    "## 1. Language overview\n",
    "\n",
    " - Note: this is *not* a language course! Though I'll cover the important bits of the language (and standard library) that are relevant to class material, I expect you to master the language on your own time.\n",
    "- Additionally cover relevant library APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- is *interpreted*\n",
    "    - The opposite is just a compiled code, C runs directly through to an executable that is directly compiled into machine code. This compilation process produces a static \n",
    "    - interpreted languages take the code and hand it to the interpreter which isntantaneously performs the actions of translation and execution.But there is *never* a static representation, ie an executable.\n",
    "    - there are other concepts such as just in time compilation, etc\n",
    "    - tl;dr hand the script to the interpreter and then it runs\n",
    "        - benefits: runs very easily\n",
    "        - downside: dont have an executable, dont know before time if it will run, and unlike compiled languages it wont be as fast because you have to dynamically compile it each time, and also you lose out on some compiler based optimization\n",
    "- is *dynamically-typed* (vs. statically typed)\n",
    "    - statically typed: its nonchanging, its fixed, when you declare a variable you are stuck in that type paradigm, the compiler is doing type checking often in these\n",
    "    - dynamically typed: you can change the type later on \n",
    "        - benefits: easier for prototyping, but you no longer have type information associated with the variables\n",
    "    - ex: Java fxn\n",
    "        int sum(int x, int y);\n",
    "        sum(10,20);\n",
    "        sum(10, \"hello) // would throw a type error, and this is enforced by the compiler or interpreter\n",
    "    - ex: Python function\n",
    "        def sum(x,y);\n",
    "        sum(10, \"hello\"); // python will be fine with this, path of least resistance\n",
    "- is *automatically memory-managed* (garbage collected)\n",
    "    - dont need to malloc, or manually free it \n",
    "    - talking heap based allocation\n",
    "- supports *procedural*, *object-oriented*, *imperative* and *functional* programming paradigms\n",
    "    - overall this means its flexible in terms of code organization and representation of modules\n",
    "- is designed (mostly) by one man: Guido van Rossum (aka “benevolent dictator”), and therefore has a fairly *opinionated* design\n",
    "    - good because it brings a cohesiveness, unlike a design by committee language\n",
    "- has a single reference implementation (CPython)\n",
    "    - there is one interpreter that is the defacto interpreter\n",
    "    - called cPython because it is written in C\n",
    "    - reference implementation versus specification\n",
    "        - pythons spec is defined by the reference implementation\n",
    "- version 3 (the most recent version) is *not backwards-compatible* with version 2, though the latter is still widely used\n",
    "    - relevant in python outside of this class\n",
    "    - python3 is NOT backwards compatible will version 2, it will not necesarrily run on the python2 interpreter\n",
    "    - ex: print is a function not a statement now\n",
    "- has an interesting programming philosophy: \"There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.\" (a.k.a. the \"Pythonic\" way) — see [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)"
